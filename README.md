# Reservoir_Visualization
A visualization project utilizing Altair

This project examines data collected from the state of California about the storage of water in some reservoirs (not all reservoirs in the state are represented in the data). The data can be found at the following link:

Additionally the storage capacity from the Oroville reservoir, San Luis reservoir, and Castaic reservoir were taken from the California Department of Water Resources.
Oroville: https://water.ca.gov/Programs/State-Water-Project/SWP-Facilities/Oroville
San Luis: https://water.ca.gov/Programs/State-Water-Project/SWP-Facilities/San-Luis
Castaic: https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-Pages/Programs/State-Water-Project/Operations-And-Maintenance/Files/Operations-Control-Office/Project-Wide-Operations/Castaic-Weekly-Reservoir-Storage-Chart.pdf?la=en&hash=AE330834B55597364231707D6E7C52E6273EABAD

Goals of the Visualization:
  1. Is there a long term trend that is easily identifiable in the summed storage of Californias reservoirs?
  2. Through visual means can a common cyclical trend be identified between years?
  3. Can visualization provide historical context for the current drought California is suffering?
 
Notes:
For the final visualization, individual years can be selected by clicking on the legend. To select multiple years, shift-click each year you want to be displayed. Finally to clear all current selections and display all years, double click the legend.
